# Full-Stack AI Template

A modern full-stack template project for creating AI-powered applications.

## Getting started
To create a new project, explore the `/paths` directory to find different project templates, then use them to quickly scaffold your project!

You can customize the Path's prompt template to suit your needs.

## Development
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

The page will automatically update as you make changes to the code.

## Preview
When you start the development server, you'll see output similar to this:
```bash
> next dev
  ▲ Next.js 14.2.7
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
 ✓ Starting...
 ✓ Ready in 2.2s
 ✓ Compiled / in 1725ms (529 modules)
```

This indicates that:
- The Next.js server is running
- Your local development URL is http://localhost:3000
- The initial compilation is complete
- The application is ready to use
